This week I learnt I need to work more closely with those assigned to the same user story. I shared a large story with four other people, and my strategy was to cut out what I reckoned was a fair piece of the story, implement that part of it and leave it. This was of course a mistake since what I did wasn't independent - if it were, it would have been its own separate story - and two of the four members assigned to the story were economists, who were unsurprisingly completely lost with what I left them. I ended up having to pull a late shift to communicate with and teach them what had to be done, but we ended up getting the story finished on time. Good job us.
