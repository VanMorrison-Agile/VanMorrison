This sprint went along smoothly, we're learning to get things done. I messed up and accidentally merged without approval, but that's tellingly the worst thing that happened - speaking of, we do need to learn how to manage branches and merging, something I lack experience in having worked with smaller less active groups. I've got what one might call a nasty merge conflict to resolve ahead of me, so that's exciting.
