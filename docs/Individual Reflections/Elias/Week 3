I wrote all of the code we delivered this sprint - which I'm entirely fine with - however, there was not a lot of code.
I expect we will have more coding requirements in the next sprint's backlog, and I will probably not shoulder it all. We'll have to work together to figure out how to deliver compatible code while splitting up different parts of the program between ourselves.
I personally dread deciding what needs to be coded more than I do the coding itself and hope other team members will be more excited to, so to speak, tell me what to do, but I'll confer with them to some extent.
