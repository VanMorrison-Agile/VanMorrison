This sprint we finished up and I only solved some bugs not related to the new user stories. I offered help to the rest of the team but they didn't need it. We weren't very ambitious this sprint since it was the last one and we didn't want to risk delivering an incomplete product. We could probably have delivered more in the final sprint if we were more confident and thus more daring planning work for sprints, but perhaps we didn't have to.
