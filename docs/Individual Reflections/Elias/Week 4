I feel like I let the team down this week - I did a lot of work, but much of it went to waste due to poor communication. I feel like I've genuinely learnt an important lesson about working in a larger group. (I've never developed software together with more than half as many people as this before)

Another group member asked for help with a task assigned to them and I set out to see what I could do - so far so good - but I ended up spending a lot of time trying to do someone else's job and get ideas for the project that, while I did discuss with some members of the team, didn't properly communicate to everyone, and I did not wait for a decision to be made by the group before starting to write code in a completely different programming language, and my ideas were later turned down by the team in a proper meeting, and I ended up neglecting the work I WAS supposed to do and didn't finish my tasks...

In short, I learned that I am only a fraction of the people in my team - really, I've realized why this whole project management system is needed in the first place. I cannot work as if I were casually making something by myself or with only a couple other people. In the future, I'll show more respect toward the sprint plan, and I won't try to make decisions too quickly, making sure the team is in on everything.
