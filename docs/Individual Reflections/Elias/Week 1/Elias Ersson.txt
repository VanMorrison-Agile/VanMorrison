I want to learn more about agile project management and scrum specifically, both what the components are and more importantly why the components are.
I don't really know how I could actively help the rest of the team with learning, so maybe that's something to think about, but I am very happy to reactively help if I catch wind of anything specific someone wants to learn that I believe I can help with.
For now I will try to help the team figure out the nature of our project, despite my distaste for having to come up with something to make for the sake of making it.
